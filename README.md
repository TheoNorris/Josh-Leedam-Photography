I am creating this project in order to showcase Josh Leedam's Photography. I will be using HTML and CSS to create a website 
containing five pages. A home page, a page of the photographers work, a thubnail page, a page containing a brief history of the photographer
and a contact page.

 ## UX

 This website will be created to promote Josh Leedam's photography to potential fans, customers and employers.
 The site users will be supporters of his work, enthusiasts of photography/wildlife/nature and customers/employers.
 The website will be a simple, sleek and beautiful website with easy to navigate links, showcasing some of the photographers 
 most stunning work.

 * As a user I can see what the main focus of the website is.
 * As a user I can navigate myself to any social media the photographer has.
 * As a user I can navigate myself through the additional pages efficiently and effectively.
 * As a user I can view the photograpers work.
 * As a user I can fill out a form registering for newsletters.
 * As a user I can contact the photographer in regards to purchasing work or offering contracts.

My wireframes were made using Balsamic Wireframes. You can view them [here](assets/readme-documents/milestone-project-one-wireframes.pdf).

## Existing Features

 * A navigation bar allowing users to scroll through the various pages.

## Testing

Having written my code for each .html page I have validated them on [The W3C Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/).
The same applies to my css which I have validated on [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

1. Navbar
* Going through each of the pages, I clicked on each navigation bar link to ensure all pages worked individually.

2. Social Media links
- I went to the social media links on each of the pages and clicked on them to ensure they opened up in new tabs using 'target="_blank"'.

3. Newsletter form
- On each page  I checked the newsletter form was responsive and each input required text. I then repeated the process with each box until the form was filled.

4. Photopage carousel
- On the photo page I checked if the carousel was responsive in all media sizes by scrolling through it on each media platform.

5. Portfolio thumbnail link
- I navigated to the portfolio page. clicked on the thumbnail page link. ensured the page opened in the same window correctly.

6. Thumbnail page
- Went through each individual thumbnail and clicked on them to ensure they were all opened in their individual tabs.

7. Contact form
- I checked the contact form was responsive and each input required text. I completed this by trying to submit the form without any text. I then repeated the process with each box until the form was filled.

This website was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft edge.) It is also responsive, having
tested it on chrome developer tools across ipad, various iphones, samsungs etc. I have also tested it on iphone x, iphone 7, macbook
and desktop.
On smaller resolution screens I have extracted some features from the contact page. I have taken away the newsletter form and image on mobile devices.
This is in order to keep the page clean, fresh and minimalistic.
